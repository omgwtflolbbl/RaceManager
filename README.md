# RaceManager
This project has a few goals:

-Build a scraper for MultiGP to pull information about races and racers

-Quickly build a server and DB to pull/store data about these races and racers

-Create mobile apps to organize and share these races and provide realtime notifications regarding race information and scheduling (because we're god awful about that)

The server will be built up with Flask and will use Firebase for a RTDB and notifications. No particular reason behind choosing these technologies other than "let's learn something about NoSQL".

Android will come first, iOS afterwards.
